# Weather Journal App Project
![Weather Journal App](./website/image/app-design.JPG?raw=true "Weather Journal App")


## Project Overview
In this project, I have built an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. This weather Journal App allows users enter the zip code of the desired location and feelings, so that users will record their feelings with weather info.


## What did I do?
I have implemented the followings on top of the starter code provided by [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/).
- Set up a Node environment with Express.
- Set up a server with GET and POST routes.
- Create a developer credential for a Web API.
- Develop a GET request to handle the request to external API on form submission.
- Develop a POST request to handle incoming data. 
- Develop a function to dynamically update UI.
- Develop a function to store and display history.
- Creating layouts and page design with CSS that should be usable across modern desktop, tablet, and phone browsers.


## Tech stack
- Programming Languages - JavaScript, CSS, HTML
- Webserver - Node, Body-Parser, Cors.
- Web application framework for routing - Express
- External API - [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/)


## Getting started
### Step 1: Install Dependencies

### Step 2: Signup for a API key
Signing up will get you a API key.
- [OpenWeatherMap](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up)


### Step 3: Declare your a API key
- Declare your API key in app.js.


### Step 4: Running the Server
- Start the server.
